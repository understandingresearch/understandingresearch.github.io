Quantitative research Quantitative research is useful for studying measurable phenomena. It tries to explain phenomena by collecting data, and analyze them using mathematical methods, especially statistics. In health research, quantitative research can answer the questions such as: How many cases of a disease exist in a popuplation? What proportion of people with a disease survives 5 years after the diagnosis? Does a new treatment decrease the symptoms of a disease compared to the traditional treatment? Goals of quantitative research The central goal of quantitative research is the generalization of findings. It is often impossible to study a whole population. Generally, we will study a representative sample of that population. Generalization means that the researchers will extend the results founds from a sample to the whole population. Quantitative research also allows to study hypotheses using statistical tests. For example, a researcher can be interested in comparing the following two hypotheses: The influenza vaccine reduces the number of hospitalizations per year, and The influenza vaccine does not reduce the number of hospitalizations per year To test these hypotheses, a quantitative study can be performed to compare the number of elderly people hospitalized among those who have been vaccinated and those who have not been vaccinated. Statistical tests are used to compare the groups, which consider the sample size and variability of the observed results. It will tell us the probability that the observed results are due to chance or not. It is very important to note that it is always possible to obtain incorrect \"results\" in quantitative research. A methodological error can very easily lead to erroneous conclusions. Thus, rigour of the methods is particularly important. Types of quantitative health research Field Study Example Biomedical science To study living organisms, their responses to disease processes and therapies Does the new antibiotic kill more germs than the old one? Clinical research To study the efficacy and safety of treatments and diagnostic products Does the new antibiotic treat a disease faster compared to traditional treatment? Public health research To study disease prevention and health promotion Does the use of the new antibiotic reduce the number of hospitalizations? Health services research To answer health services questions Did doctors prescribe the new antibiotic to patients in need? Study designs There are two general types of study designs within quantitative methods: Experimental Observational Within these, there are several subtypes. Type Study design Example Experimental Randomized controlled trial Researchers determine, through a controlled process, the exposure for each individual (clinical trial) or community (community trial), and then track the individuals or communities over time to detect the effects of the exposure; participants are allocated at random to the intervention or control groups Observational Cohort (longitudinal) Researchers record whether each study subject is exposed or not, and then track the subjects to see if they develop the disease being studied Case-control study Researchers enroll a group of people with the disease (cases) and a group without the disease (controls), then compare previous exposures to different factors between the two groups Cross-sectional study Researchers enroll a sample of people from a population and their exposures and health outcomes are measured simultaneously at a specific point in time Ecological (population-based) Researchers measure disease rates and different determinants for each unit (each population), and the relationships between disease rates and determinants are examined Statistics in health research The observations of the studies are expressed in quantifiable data. Statistics is the analysis and interpretation of quantifiable data. Biostatistics is the science of collecting and analyzing numerical data in large quantities \u201cfor addressing, analyzing and solving problems in public health; health care; and biomedical, clinical and population-based research\u201d (Calhoun, Ramiah, Weist, Shortell, 2008). Two types of statistics are often used in health research: Descriptive statistics Inferential statistics Descriptive statistics describes, organizes, summarizes and presents variables and numerical data. They do not allow us to make conclusions beyond the data we have analysed or reach conclusions regarding any hypotheses we might have made. They are simply a way to describe our data. Descriptive statistics are very important because it would be hard to visualize what the data was showing if we simply presented our raw data, especially if there was a lot of it. Therefore, descriptive statistics enables us to present the data in a more meaningful way, which allows simpler interpretation of the data. Inferential statistics are techniques that allow us to use results from samples to make generalizations about the populations from which the samples were drawn. It is, therefore, important that the sample accurately represents the population. Additional resources Forthcoming. Big data and health research Whereas statisticians and early data scientists were often limited to working with \u201csample\u201d sets of data, big data has enabled data scientists to access and work with massive sets of data without restriction. Big data has caused the scientific community to re-examine its methodology of scientific research and has triggered a revolution in scientific thinking and methods. Rather than relying on representative data samples, data scientists can now rely on the data itself, in all of its granularity, nuance, and detail. For example, artificial intelligence and machine learning have been used to study big data. Although many artificial intelligence technologies have existed for several decades, only now are they able to take advantage of datasets of sufficient size to provide meaningful learning and results. The ability to access large volumes of data with agility and ready access is leading to a rapid evolution in the application of artificial intelligence and machine-learning applications. Additional resources Articles about the use of big data in health care: Article: Big Data In Health Care: Using Analytics To Identify And Manage High-Risk And High-Cost Patients Article: The Inevitable Application of Big Data to Health Care Qualitative research Qualitative research is not used instead of quantitative research. It allows us to answer questions that cannot be answered in the same way through quantitative research. Qualitative data are collected by speaking to people, by observing people and situations, and systematically recording our observations (taking notes, photographs, videos, etc). In this way, qualitative research allows us to gain an in-depth understanding of a phenomenon. Is Is not Objective To understand a phenomenon To measure a phenomenon Questions What? How? Why? How many? Questions with yes/no answers Data Words, images, sound(s), interviews, observations Numbers, questionnaires, survey, documents Transferability Qualitative research results are not being generalized to larger populations. This is not possible because, among other things, the samples are generally small. The richness of qualitative research is in the level of detail; the depth of the results. Transferability is the qualitative \u201cequivalent\u201d of generalizability. The objective is to present the results with enough details for the reader to see if they are transferable in their context. Perspectives and dimensions Not everyone understands or perceives a phenomenon the same way. Qualitative research allows us to examine the different perceptions of those experiencing the phenomenon from different perspectives. Frames of reference When we report the results of a qualitative study, one goal is to make sure our audience understands the phenomenon in the way we intend. The frame of reference we use to analyse and describe a phenomenon can alter the way our audience perceives it. Qualitative research allows us to understand phenomena in different ways. Construction and deconstruction To understand a phenomenon in qualitative research, we may break it apart into its many \"pieces\" and fit the \"pieces\" back together in new ways. For instance, in a qualitative study we tease apart transcriptions of interviews into discreet categories. This data analysis process is referred to as \"coding\". Additional resources Video overview of qualitative research methods: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsAUNs-IoSQ Mixed methods research Mixed method research refers to the combination and integration of qualitative and quantitative methods in the same study or research. Challenges of mixed methods Challenge Integration Integration of qualitative and quantitative in the data collection and analysis process is key in mixed methods (not the simple addition of 2 distinct studies) Strategy Mixed methods is used when this strategy allows researchers to better address a research question When a qualitative study appears alongside a quantitative study in a research study, it is not necessarily a mixed methods research per se. In other words, the mixed methods research does not propose the simple addition of separate qualitative and quantitative studies. Rather, mixed methods research seeks to integrate both quantitative and qualitative components in the same study to answer the same general research question. Integration is therefore a key element of the mixed methods research. It refers to the interface point between the quantitative and qualitative components in a mixed methods research. A mixed methods approach is used when integrating qualitative and quantitative information to better answer research questions. Mixed methods may be chosen when: There is a need to interpret quantitative results There is a need to statistically generalize qualitative results There is a need both to explore (qualitatively) and to measure (quantitatively) a phenomenon Mixed methods approaches Three basic mixed methods research designs are frequently observed. Research design Description Example Convergent design Qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis are done separately, then the results of both are compared or combined For example, researchers are interested in understanding the barriers and facilitators to the implementation of a new program. To achieve this goal, they decide to conduct a survey with the participants (quantitative) and interviews with the clinicians (qualitative). Then, they compare the results found for each method. Sequential exploratory design The first phase is qualitative. The qualitative results inform the data collection of the second phase, which is quantitative. This design can be used to develop a measurement tool. First, interviews will be conducted to generate a list of items considered important by experts and create a first version of the measurement tool. Then, a quantitative study is conducted to study the psychometric properties of this tool (e.g. factor analysis). Sequential explanatory design In this design, the first phase is quantitative. The quantitative results inform the data collection of the second phase, which is qualitative. A quantitative study is conducted to study the effectiveness of an intervention. Then, a qualitative study is conducted to explain why the intervention did not work for some participants. Mixed methods strategy Advantages Challenges The strengths of each type of method can compensate for the limits of the other The research process can be complex and require a significant amount of time and resources Mixed methods research provides a more complete and in-depth understanding of the studied phenomenon than a quantitative or qualitative approach alone Can potentially require additional training and equipment (e.g., specialized software) Quantitative research will generally provide access to one or more explanations that are more general and give measures, generalizable descriptions, general trends (e.g., statistical analyses on a large group of people). Qualitative research will generally provide access to a more in-depth understanding of complex phenomena in a specific context (e.g., individual interviews to understand the perspective of members of a social group). By combining the two, mixed methods research can potentially compensate for the limitations of each method in understanding a phenomenon in both its general and specific aspects. Mixed methods allow a more complete and in-depth understanding of the phenomenon under study than a quantitative or qualitative approach used alone. The idea here is that by combining and integrating the strengths of qualitative and quantitative methods, it will be possible to better explain the complexity of a phenomenon. However, this requires researchers or research teams to have a good understanding of both qualitative and quantitative methods.

In other words, the mixed methods research does not propose the simple addition of separate qualitative and quantitative studies. Rather, mixed methods research seeks to integrate both quantitative and qualitative components in the same study to answer the same general research question. Integration is therefore a key element of the mixed methods research. It refers to the interface point between the quantitative and qualitative components in a mixed methods research. A mixed methods approach is used when integrating qualitative and quantitative information to better answer research questions. Mixed methods may be chosen when: There is a need to interpret quantitative results There is a need to statistically generalize qualitative results There is a need both to explore (qualitatively) and to measure (quantitatively) a phenomenon","title":"Challenges of mixed methods"},{"location":"methodology_en/#mixed-methods-approaches","text":"Three basic mixed methods research designs are frequently observed. Research design Description Example Convergent design Qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis are done separately, then the results of both are compared or combined For example, researchers are interested in understanding the barriers and facilitators to the implementation of a new program. To achieve this goal, they decide to conduct a survey with the participants (quantitative) and interviews with the clinicians (qualitative). Then, they compare the results found for each method. Sequential exploratory design The first phase is qualitative. The qualitative results inform the data collection of the second phase, which is quantitative. This design can be used to develop a measurement tool. First, interviews will be conducted to generate a list of items considered important by experts and create a first version of the measurement tool. Then, a quantitative study is conducted to study the psychometric properties of this tool (e.g. factor analysis). Sequential explanatory design In this design, the first phase is quantitative. The quantitative results inform the data collection of the second phase, which is qualitative. A quantitative study is conducted to study the effectiveness of an intervention. Then, a qualitative study is conducted to explain why the intervention did not work for some participants.","title":"Mixed methods approaches"},{"location":"methodology_en/#mixed-methods-strategy","text":"Advantages Challenges The strengths of each type of method can compensate for the limits of the other The research process can be complex and require a significant amount of time and resources Mixed methods research provides a more complete and in-depth understanding of the studied phenomenon than a quantitative or qualitative approach alone Can potentially require additional training and equipment (e.g., specialized software) Quantitative research will generally provide access to one or more explanations that are more general and give measures, generalizable descriptions, general trends (e.g., statistical analyses on a large group of people). Qualitative research will generally provide access to a more in-depth understanding of complex phenomena in a specific context (e.g., individual interviews to understand the perspective of members of a social group). By combining the two, mixed methods research can potentially compensate for the limitations of each method in understanding a phenomenon in both its general and specific aspects. Mixed methods allow a more complete and in-depth understanding of the phenomenon under study than a quantitative or qualitative approach used alone. The idea here is that by combining and integrating the strengths of qualitative and quantitative methods, it will be possible to better explain the complexity of a phenomenon.

The main steps are as follows: A literature review is conducted to uncover knowledge gaps. These knowledge gaps guide the research objectives and research questions. Before the project can begin, it must receive ethical approval from the appropriate institutional review board(s). Data is collected and analyzed using the appropriate research method (qualitative, quantitative or mixed methods) to produce results. These results are interpreted by, communicated to, or applied with, stakeholders in the knowledge translation phase. Above: General overview of research steps. Literature review Research is based on existing knowledge and expected to fill knowledge gaps. Therefore, any research project begins with (is based on) a literature review . A literature review aims to summarize, combine, analyze, comment or critique existing publications on a given topic. Nowadays, literature reviews represent a large portion of the scientific literature published and consulted by the scientific and non-scientific community. Also, systematic reviews are used to enable decision-making based on the best available evidence. What is a literature review for? \u200bDraw a portrait of a given topic Identify questions or aspects of the topic that require more research\u200b (knowledge gaps) Situate one\u2019s work within existing literature\u200b (previous studies) Justify the relevance of a project and the research methodology employed Keep up to date on a given topic Two main types of literature reviews There are several types of literature reviews. The two main types are traditional and systematic. Traditional review Systematic review Non-reproducible Reproducible \u200b Transparent \u200b Explicit No method Clear and rigorous method Traditionally, the methods used to conduct literature reviews were not always very explicit. Such reviews were criticized for their lack of objectivity and scientific rigour. For example, only a few studies on a given topic are identified, the selection of studies seems arbitrary (without clear selection criteria), and the analysis of studies is influenced by the researcher's preconceptions. To increase scientific rigour, researchers have been interested in developing methods to make the review process more rigorous. In the \"traditional\" review there is generally no method described and therefore, it cannot be reproduced. Various terms are used to describe this type of review, for example, simply \"literature review\" or \"critical review\". At the other extreme, there is systematic review, which is one of the most rigorous types of review. Here, the method is clear and various strategies are used to increase scientific rigour. Systematic review A systematic review is a type of literature review that uses explicit and systematic methods to identify, select, evaluate and analyze studies in order to answer a specific review question.\u200b For example, researchers will search different databases and other sources to ensure that they find all the relevant studies. Also, there will be very clear selection criteria and two people (independent reviewers) will be involved in all stages of the review to avoid possible selection bias. Characteristics of a systematic review: tranparent reproducible explicit comprehensive Other types of reviews Rapid review Review produced for decision-makers that need an answer\u200b quickly; may simplify or omit certain steps of the systematic review \u200b \u200b Review of reviews Review that analyzes multiple systematic reviews\u200b \u200b Scoping review Review that evaluates the extent of knowledge on a given topic, how much literature exists and the characteristics of that literature Additional resources Systematic reviews measuring the effectiveness of health interventions and programs: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egJlW4vkb1Yf Guidance on qualitative and quantitative review: http://pareonline.net/pdf/v14n13.pdf Research ethics Ethics constitute norms of conduct that distinguish and define behaviors that are acceptable, and those that are not.\u200b Different disciplines, professions and organizations have norms of conduct that correspond to their needs and objectives. \u200bResearch ethics correspond to the principles and standards that prevent misconduct (e.g., fabrication, falsification or misrepresentation of research data) and protect the research participants.\u200b Historical context Research involving humans has been part of medicine for centuries. However, it was in the 19th century, that it truly emerged with the adoption of the experimental method in both science and medicine. By the beginning of the 20th century, the idea of conducting research involving humans was becoming more acceptable, although most studies were first conducted on animals. Unfortunately, research studies in bacteriology at the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th century across North America and Europe involved unethical practices. Although medical and scientific associations condemned these practices, this did not result in any professional, disciplinary or criminal charges. It was only following the Second World War and the Nuremberg trials that such charges were laid. The judges\u2019 verdict in 1947 included a section entitled \u201cPermissible Medical Experiments\u201d, which described ten principles to be followed in conducting research on humans. Known today as the \u201cNuremberg Code\u201d, it states as its first principle that \u201cthe voluntary consent of the human subject is essential\u201d. Canadian context A key step to ensure the ethical acceptability of a research project is to have an independent review (i.e., review by someone other than the researchers involved in the study). The first Canadian requirement for an independent review of research protocols by a Research Ethics Board (REB) was in the 1978 Medical Research Council guidelines. In 1998, the Medical Research Council (now the Canadian Institutes of Health Research-CIHR) together with two other federal research councils, the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) and Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC), published a single set of guidelines: The Tri-Council Policy Statement: Ethical Conduct for Research Involving Humans (TCPS) for research involving humans regardless of the field of research. The Tri-Council Policy Statement: Ethical Conduct for Research Involving Humans - TCPS 2 (2018) regulates research done on human beings in all scientific fields. This policy views the ethical principles as expressions of the overarching value of human dignity and a \u201ccompass\u201d to providing necessary protections for research participants while serving legitimate needs of research. Research Ethics Board (REB) Given that researchers can no longer evaluate on their own the ethical acceptability of their research projects, this mandate is given to a Research ethics board (REB) . An REB is responsible to annually evaluate and approve any research project involving human beings. REBs are usually composed of researchers, ethicists, lawyers and members of the public.\u200b The primary mandate of an institutional (e.g., university, hospital) REB is the protection, safety and well-being of all human participants involved in research conducted under the institution\u2019s responsibility.
