Understanding research concepts is known as research literacy . It establishes a common language among patients, managers, clinicians and researchers who may collaborate on research projects. What is research literacy Research literacy is defined as being sufficiently familiar with scientific ethics and methods to understand basic research concepts (knowledge), respect research ethics (attitude), and communicate with researchers and research participants (behavior). This definition is adapted from Nebeker and L\u00f3pez-Arenas (2016). Who this platform is for Understanding Research is intended for patients, managers, clinicians and anyone interested in research and collaboration with researchers (stakeholders). Why we created this platform Help stakeholders understand and use a common research language Enable research teams, patients and members of the public to prepare their partnerships Guide research teams, patients and members of the public through the important steps of research Enable research teams, patients and members of the public to have access to several external references that will help them in their partnerships How the platform is organized The platform consists of this website in conjunction with an Open Science Framework (OSF) repository . The website provides textual content on research literacy, while the OSF repository provides public access to the training materials we have developed, all available under a Creative Commons license. The OSF repository also contains a workbook with expanded information for each topic covered on this website. The platform is organized into the following themes: Research: An introduction to science, research, and ethics Literature Reviews: An introduction to the types of literature reviews and instruction on how to read research articles Methodology: An explanation of qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods research, and the participatory approach Knowledge Translation: An introduction to evidence synthesis and dissemination The Open Science Framework repository hosts our research literacy training materials, including: PowerPoint slides for research literacy workshops Accompanying workbook for participants - Download workbook Brief videos explaining various concepts - View videos About us The mission of the Quebec SPOR Support Unit is to contribute to meeting the needs of patients and stakeholders in the health and social services network through concrete actions and to build a critical mass of multidisciplinary methodological expertise aligned with these needs.

Therefore, any research project begins with (is based on) a literature review . A literature review aims to summarize, combine, analyze, comment or critique existing publications on a given topic. Nowadays, literature reviews represent a large portion of the scientific literature published and consulted by the scientific and non-scientific community. Also, systematic reviews are used to enable decision-making based on the best available evidence. Purpose of literature reviews \u200bDraw a portrait of a given topic Identify questions or aspects of the topic that require more research\u200b (knowledge gaps) Situate one\u2019s work within existing literature\u200b (previous studies) Justify the relevance of a project and the research methodology employed Keep up to date on a given topic Main types of literature reviews There are several types of literature reviews. The two main types are traditional and systematic. Traditional review Systematic review Non-reproducible Reproducible \u200b Transparent \u200b Explicit No method Clear and rigorous method Traditionally, the methods used to conduct literature reviews were not always very explicit. Such reviews were criticized for their lack of objectivity and scientific rigour. For example, only a few studies on a given topic are identified, the selection of studies seems arbitrary (without clear selection criteria), and the analysis of studies is influenced by the researcher's preconceptions. To increase scientific rigour, researchers have been interested in developing methods to make the review process more rigorous. In the \"traditional\" review there is generally no method described and therefore, it cannot be reproduced. Various terms are used to describe this type of review, for example, simply \"literature review\" or \"critical review\". At the other extreme, there is systematic review, which is one of the most rigorous types of review. Here, the method is clear and various strategies are used to increase scientific rigour. Systematic review A systematic review is a type of literature review that uses explicit and systematic methods to identify, select, evaluate and analyze studies in order to answer a specific review question.\u200b For example, researchers will search different databases and other sources to ensure that they find all the relevant studies. Also, there will be very clear selection criteria and two people (independent reviewers) will be involved in all stages of the review to avoid possible selection bias. Characteristics of a systematic review: tranparent reproducible explicit comprehensive Other types of reviews Rapid review Review produced for decision-makers that need an answer\u200b quickly; may simplify or omit certain steps of the systematic review \u200b \u200b Review of reviews Review that analyzes multiple systematic reviews\u200b \u200b Scoping review Review that evaluates the extent of knowledge on a given topic, how much literature exists and the characteristics of that literature Thank you for helping us improve this section by completing a short survey . How to read a research article The volume of research articles is ever-growing and can be overwhelming. They can be organized in three big groups: Primary research: original studies Secondary research: literature reviews, secondary analysis Other: editorials, program descriptions, guidelines Please see our video about how to read a research article. To recognize research articles, you can look for format and characteristics unique to research. Typically, research articles have the following sections and subsections: Beginning Body End Title Introduction Conclusion Authors Methods References Abstract Results Funding Keywords Discussion Components of a research article In the following table, each component of an article is explained: Component Explanation Title What the article is about. It may include the word \u201cresearch\u201d or specific study design to help you identify if the article is reporting empirical research. For example, some titles will tell you right away the nature of the study (e.g., a systematic review). Authors Includes the authors' names and their institutions (e.g., universities or hospitals). Name of the journal Allows you to verify whether the journal is peer-reviewed, which usually ensures conceptual and methodological quality. Date of publication Allows you to identify research currency, as more current research may be more relevant. Abstract Summary of the article. The abstract helps you determine whether to read the entire article or not, and are often available for free online. Most scientific journals have a structured abstract with headings (i.e., introduction, methods, results, conclusions). Non-research articles may have an abstract, but will not discuss the research process. Keywords Terms that describe the article. They are provided by the authors, or added by librarians or automatically (computer indexing). You can use these to find related articles. Introduction Describes the problem the authors are trying to solve. This section will usually conclude with the specific research questions. Methods Describes what the authors did: the study design, when, where and how they collected the data, ethics committee approval, and how the data was analyzed. Results Focuses on what the results are and not what they mean. The first part of the Results section will often describe the participants (how many and who they were). Discussion Includes the interpretation of the results and implications of the study. The authors may connect their findings to earlier work, discuss unexpected findings, study limitations and strengths. Conclusion Closes the article, provides overall conclusions and ideas for future research. References Citations of sources used by authors, and can help you identify related studies. Funding information Identifies who funded the study and helps to identify potential conflict of interest. Reading an article may take a very long time at first and require reading it many times. As you read, take notes and read critically \u2013 do not assume the authors are always correct. Finally, there are different approaches to reading research articles. Some say do not read the abstract; others say to read the title, abstract, and conclusions first. Try different approaches and see what works for you.

Science involves asking questions, making observations and evaluating the ideas that come out of observations. In other words, science aims to ask research questions and design studies that can answer these questions. Science is systematic, transparent, explicit and reproducible. There are several definitions of research. Creswell (2002, p.3) suggests one that is simple to understand: research is a \"process of steps used to collect and analyze information to increase our understanding of a topic or issue\" . To learn more, check out our glossary of research terms (downloadable PDF). The two types of research we often hear about are basic and applied research. Basic research Applied research Conducted to advance fundamental knowledge about the world. It is sometimes called laboratory or bench research Focuses on analyzing and solving real-world problems (e.g., discovering how effective a specific medication is)\u200b Patient-oriented research A patient is any individual that has a personal experience with a health problem, including caregivers.\u200b One of the main focuses of the Canadian Institutes for Health Research (CIHR) in the past few years is patient-oriented research . Patient-oriented research: Is about engaging patients, their caregivers, and family as partners\u200b Targets the priorities identified by the patients and improve health outcomes\u200b Is led by multidisciplinary teams in partnership with different stakeholders Aims to apply the generated knowledge to improve health care systems and practices\u200b \"Patient-oriented research is about engaging patients, their caregivers, and families as partners in the research process. This engagement helps to ensure that studies focus on patient-identified priorities, which ultimately leads to better patient outcomes.\" (CIHR-IRSC) General view of research steps Like other research projects, a patient-oriented research project will include the research problem, needs (knowledge gaps), objectives, questions, and methods. The main steps are as follows: A literature review is conducted to uncover knowledge gaps. These knowledge gaps guide the research objectives and research questions. Before the project can begin, it must receive ethical approval from the appropriate institutional review board(s). Data is collected and analyzed using the appropriate research method (qualitative, quantitative or mixed methods) to produce results. These results are interpreted by, communicated to, or applied with, stakeholders in the knowledge translation phase. Above: General overview of research steps. Thank you for helping us improve this section by completing a short survey . Research ethics Ethics constitute norms of conduct that distinguish and define behaviors that are acceptable, and those that are not.\u200b Different disciplines, professions and organizations have norms of conduct that correspond to their needs and objectives. \u200bResearch ethics correspond to the principles and standards that prevent misconduct (e.g., fabrication, falsification or misrepresentation of research data) and protect the research participants.\u200b Historical context Research involving humans has been part of medicine for centuries. However, it was in the 19th century, that it truly emerged with the adoption of the experimental method in both science and medicine. By the beginning of the 20th century, the idea of conducting research involving humans was becoming more acceptable, although most studies were first conducted on animals. Unfortunately, research studies in bacteriology at the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th century across North America and Europe involved unethical practices. Although medical and scientific associations condemned these practices, this did not result in any professional, disciplinary or criminal charges. It was only following the Second World War and the Nuremberg trials that such charges were laid. The judges\u2019 verdict in 1947 included a section entitled \u201cPermissible Medical Experiments\u201d, which described ten principles to be followed in conducting research on humans. Known today as the \u201cNuremberg Code\u201d, it states as its first principle that \u201cthe voluntary consent of the human subject is essential\u201d. Canadian context A key step to ensure the ethical acceptability of a research project is to have an independent review (i.e., review by someone other than the researchers involved in the study). The first Canadian requirement for an independent review of research protocols by a Research Ethics Board (REB) was in the 1978 Medical Research Council guidelines. In 1998, the Medical Research Council (now the Canadian Institutes of Health Research-CIHR) together with two other federal research councils, the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) and Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC), published a single set of guidelines: The Tri-Council Policy Statement: Ethical Conduct for Research Involving Humans (TCPS) for research involving humans regardless of the field of research. The Tri-Council Policy Statement: Ethical Conduct for Research Involving Humans - TCPS 2 (2018) regulates research done on human beings in all scientific fields. This policy views the ethical principles as expressions of the overarching value of human dignity and a \u201ccompass\u201d to providing necessary protections for research participants while serving legitimate needs of research. Research Ethics Board (REB) Given that researchers can no longer evaluate on their own the ethical acceptability of their research projects, this mandate is given to a Research ethics board (REB) . An REB is responsible to annually evaluate and approve any research project involving human beings. REBs are usually composed of researchers, ethicists, lawyers and members of the public.\u200b The primary mandate of an institutional (e.g., university, hospital) REB is the protection, safety and well-being of all human participants involved in research conducted under the institution\u2019s responsibility.

However, it was in the 19th century, that it truly emerged with the adoption of the experimental method in both science and medicine. By the beginning of the 20th century, the idea of conducting research involving humans was becoming more acceptable, although most studies were first conducted on animals. Unfortunately, research studies in bacteriology at the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th century across North America and Europe involved unethical practices. Although medical and scientific associations condemned these practices, this did not result in any professional, disciplinary or criminal charges. It was only following the Second World War and the Nuremberg trials that such charges were laid. The judges\u2019 verdict in 1947 included a section entitled \u201cPermissible Medical Experiments\u201d, which described ten principles to be followed in conducting research on humans.

Integration Integration of qualitative and quantitative in the data collection and analysis process is key in mixed methods (not the simple addition of 2 distinct studies) Strategy Mixed methods is used when this strategy allows researchers to better address a research question When a qualitative study appears alongside a quantitative study in a research study, it is not necessarily a mixed methods research per se. In other words, the mixed methods research does not propose the simple addition of separate qualitative and quantitative studies. Rather, mixed methods research seeks to integrate both quantitative and qualitative components in the same study to answer the same general research question. Integration is therefore a key element of the mixed methods research. It refers to the interface point between the quantitative and qualitative components in a mixed methods research. When to use mixed methods Mixed methods are used when integrating qualitative and quantitative information is needed to better answer the research questions. Mixed methods may be chosen when there is a need: To interpret quantitative results To statistically generalize qualitative results To both explore (qualitatively) and to measure (quantitatively) a phenomenon Mixed methods designs Three basic mixed methods research designs are frequently observed. Research design Description Example Convergent design Qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis are done separately, then the results of both are compared or combined For example, researchers are interested in understanding the barriers and facilitators to the implementation of a new program. To achieve this goal, they decide to conduct a survey with the participants (quantitative) and interviews with the clinicians (qualitative). Then, they compare the results found for each method. Sequential exploratory design The first phase is qualitative. The qualitative results inform the data collection of the second phase, which is quantitative. This design can be used to develop a measurement tool. First, interviews will be conducted to generate a list of items considered important by experts and create a first version of the measurement tool. Then, a quantitative study is conducted to study the psychometric properties of this tool (e.g. factor analysis). Sequential explanatory design In this design, the first phase is quantitative. The quantitative results inform the data collection of the second phase, which is qualitative. A quantitative study is conducted to study the effectiveness of an intervention.

It tries to explain phenomena by collecting data, and analyze them using mathematical methods, especially statistics. In health research, quantitative research can answer questions such as: How many cases of a disease exist in a population? What proportion of people with a disease survives 5 years after the diagnosis? Does a new treatment decrease the symptoms of a disease compared to the traditional treatment? Goals of quantitative research The central goal of quantitative research is the generalization of findings. It is often impossible to study a whole population. Generally, we will study a representative sample of that population. Generalization means that the researchers will extend the results founds from a sample to the whole population. Quantitative research also allows to study hypotheses using statistical tests. For example, a researcher can be interested in comparing the following two hypotheses: The influenza vaccine reduces the number of hospitalizations per year, and The influenza vaccine does not reduce the number of hospitalizations per year To test these hypotheses, a quantitative study can be performed to compare the number of elderly people hospitalized among those who have been vaccinated and those who have not been vaccinated. Statistical tests are used to compare the groups, which consider the sample size and variability of the observed results. It will tell us the probability that the observed results are due to chance or not. It is very important to note that it is always possible to obtain incorrect \"results\" in quantitative research. A methodological error can very easily lead to erroneous conclusions. Thus, rigour of the methods is particularly important. Types of quantitative health research Field Study Example Biomedical science To study living organisms, their responses to disease processes and therapies Does the new antibiotic kill more germs than the old one? Clinical research To study the efficacy and safety of treatments and diagnostic products Does the new antibiotic treat a disease faster compared to traditional treatment? Public health research To study disease prevention and health promotion Does the use of the new antibiotic reduce the number of hospitalizations? Health services research To answer health services questions Did doctors prescribe the new antibiotic to patients in need? Study designs There are two general types of study designs within quantitative methods: Experimental Observational Within these, there are several subtypes. Type Study design Example Experimental Randomized controlled trial Researchers determine, through a controlled process, the exposure for each individual (clinical trial) or community (community trial), and then track the individuals or communities over time to detect the effects of the exposure; participants are allocated at random to the intervention or control groups Observational Cohort (longitudinal) Researchers record whether each study subject is exposed or not, and then track the subjects to see if they develop the disease being studied Case-control study Researchers enroll a group of people with the disease (cases) and a group without the disease (controls), then compare previous exposures to different factors between the two groups Cross-sectional study Researchers enroll a sample of people from a population and their exposures and health outcomes are measured simultaneously at a specific point in time Ecological (population-based) Researchers measure disease rates and different determinants for each unit (each population), and the relationships between disease rates and determinants are examined Thank you for helping us improve this section by completing a short survey . Statistics in health research The observations of the studies are expressed in quantifiable data. Statistics is the analysis and interpretation of quantifiable data. Biostatistics is the science of collecting and analyzing numerical data in large quantities \u201cfor addressing, analyzing and solving problems in public health; health care; and biomedical, clinical and population-based research\u201d (Calhoun, Ramiah, Weist, Shortell, 2008). Two types of statistics are often used in health research: Descriptive statistics Inferential statistics Descriptive statistics describes, organizes, summarizes and presents variables and numerical data. They do not allow us to make conclusions beyond the data we have analysed or reach conclusions regarding any hypotheses we might have made. They are simply a way to describe our data. Descriptive statistics are very important because it would be hard to visualize what the data was showing if we simply presented our raw data, especially if there was a lot of it. Therefore, descriptive statistics enables us to present the data in a more meaningful way, which allows simpler interpretation of the data. Inferential statistics are techniques that allow us to use results from samples to make generalizations about the populations from which the samples were drawn. It is, therefore, important that the sample accurately represents the population. Big data and health research Whereas statisticians and early data scientists were often limited to working with \u201csample\u201d sets of data, big data has enabled data scientists to access and work with massive sets of data without restriction. Big data has caused the scientific community to re-examine its methodology of scientific research and has triggered a revolution in scientific thinking and methods. Rather than relying on representative data samples, data scientists can now rely on the data itself, in all of its granularity, nuance, and detail. For example, artificial intelligence and machine learning have been used to study big data. Although many artificial intelligence technologies have existed for several decades, only now are they able to take advantage of datasets of sufficient size to provide meaningful learning and results. The ability to access large volumes of data with agility and ready access is leading to a rapid evolution in the application of artificial intelligence and machine-learning applications.

Although many artificial intelligence technologies have existed for several decades, only now are they able to take advantage of datasets of sufficient size to provide meaningful learning and results. The ability to access large volumes of data with agility and ready access is leading to a rapid evolution in the application of artificial intelligence and machine-learning applications.
